He managed to visit the capital of the Roman, Byzantine, Latin and Ottoman empires, and now has become one of the largest and most attractive cities in the world. How not to get lost in the 15 millionth metropolis, and where to run in the first place, if you want to eat, drink, shop and get rich spiritually at the same time - read the new guide to the main city of Turkey.",

                "The first thing to do right at the airport is to buy a few lire (the rate is € 1 = 6 lira), but the second is <b>Istanbulkart</b>. Even if you are in the city for only a few days, it will definitely come in handy. You can buy a card in a machine at the entrance of the metro (there is a station right at the airport) for 10 lire. And 4 of them will already be on the balance sheet, and then it can be replenished for any amount. Istanbulkart is a pass for all types of public transport, including numerous ferries, and at the same time to public toilets. An irreplaceable, in general, thing. You can ride on one-time tickets, in which case each trip will cost 5 lire.",
                "By the way, about the ferries. Of course, they are sightseeing (if you wish, you can make a circle along the Bosphorus), but in general it is just one of the types of public transport, convenient, inexpensive and very romantic. There are several popular ports: in the European part these are Eminönü, Karaköy, Kabataş and Beşiktaş, in Asia the most significant are Kadşköy and Üsküdar. Ferry timetables can be found here. And don't forget to buy fresh simit bagels to feed the gulls while you ride!",
                "The transportation system in Istanbul is quite complicated: in order not to get lost, download the <b>Trafi Türkiye</b> application. Enter the point of departure and point of arrival - you get tips on how to get, indicating how much you spend time and money. And if you don’t know where you are, the application will tell you the nearest public transport stops using GPS.",
                "<b>Taxi</b> in Istanbul costs 2-3 lira per kilometer. But at rush hour it is better not to use it - there is a risk of getting stuck in traffic for a long time (the İBB Ceptrafik application helps to monitor and predict traffic in Istanbul). In addition, it is worthwhile to make sure that the driver turns on the counter. Calling a taxi by phone does not make much sense: the price will not change, and parking and free cars are often found in the city. But locals consider the BiTaksi application to be quite convenient where, after registering via Facebook, you can track tariffs and GPS tracking, as well as pay for your trip with a credit or debit card."

                "If you decide to thoroughly pump through the history and culture of Istanbul, then be prepared for the fact that you have to compete with tens of thousands of tourists in speed and arrogance. For example, you don’t even have to climb the <b>Galata Tower</b> for the sake of a magnificent view: in the summer on a tiny panoramic balcony there is movement in three rows and annoying traffic jams, and in winter it is just very cold.",
                "But there are places where it is worth to tolerate crowds of tourists, because you certainly will not see such a thing anywhere. For example, the <b>Blue Mosque</b>, it is also <b>Sultanahmet</b> <i>(At Meydanı, 7, Fatih)</i>, the largest in the city, you definitely saw it on any postcard from Turkey. It is called blue because of the white and blue tiles of handmade work, which can be estimated by getting inside. By the way, this can be done for free, the main thing is not to get to the time of prayer (the schedule is indicated next). Upon entering the mosque, go as close to the center as possible and admire the domes, tiles, inscriptions and windows until you feel dizzy.",
                "Behind the Blue Mosque on a pedestrian street lurks a mosaic museum of the <b>Grand Palace</b> <i>(Sultanahmet Mh., Arasta Çarşısı, Fatih)</i>. Once there was an imperial palace, but an earthquake completely destroyed it, and later archaeologists found mosaics, including very ancient ones. An ideal place to immerse yourself in history and relax from the constant chaotic movement of the city.",
                "By the way, lesser-known mosques deserve attention. For example, <b>Suleymaniye</b> <i>(Süleymaniye Mah., Prof. Sıddık Sami Onar cad. 1, Fatih)</i>, which was created for Suleiman the Magnificent by the famous Ottoman architect Sinan. It was recently restored and is now considered the best of the 42 surviving mosques that the architect designed for Istanbul. In addition to the architecture itself, the Suleimaniye feature is that it has preserved most of the original complex of buildings: several madrassas, a hospital, a library and a hamam. And locals are coming here to eat tasty chicken or baked beans.",
                "<b>Hagia Sophia</b> <i>(Sultanahmet Mh., Ayasofya Meydan, Fatih)</i> is another place worth visiting tourists for. This unique building was first an Orthodox cathedral, and then a mosque, and now it is a museum. For more than a thousand years, the cathedral was considered the largest church in the Christian world - until St. Peter's Cathedral was built in Rome. Hagia Sophia is almost 1,500 years old, while the building is in perfect condition. Here you can see the neighborhood of two religions: Christian murals and mosaics are organically combined with quotes from the Koran on huge billboards. Do not forget to climb onto the balcony along the steps that have been groomed for 15 centuries, and also, like every self-respecting tourist, put your finger in the crying column and scroll through 360 degrees, making a wish before it. Ticket price - 60 lire.",
                "<b>Topkapi Palace</b> <i>(Sultanahmet, Fatih)</i> was once the main palace of the Ottoman Empire, it was from here that the sultans ruled the vast state. And now there is a cluster of attractions. It is interesting to see the palaces themselves (and there are four of them - for 7 thousand square meters), to consider courtyards, gates, various premises, chambers and pavilions. Adjacent to the palace is Gülhane Parki, the oldest and one of the largest parks in the city and just a very pleasant place. Thirdly, here in the park you will find the Istanbul Historical Museum of Islamic Science and Technology - come to climb on old optical and astronomical instruments.",
                "<b>The Basilica Cistern</b> <i>(Yerebatan C 13, Sultanahmet)</i> was used as a water storage for residents of the Grand Palace in Byzantine times and the Topkapi Palace during the Ottoman Empire. The place looks completely mystical, given that it is underground - scattered light, powerful columns, methodical rattling of drops and even a couple of Medusa Gorgon, who are not afraid to look in the eyes. One of the few tourist places where even Istanbul people return several times. Entrance - 20 lire.",
                "Be sure to visit the <b>Dolmabahçe Palace</b> - the second residence of the Turkish Sultans. Everything captivates: the palace itself (the so-called office) with the world's largest chandelier, and a harem, and an art gallery (where even Aivazovsky is). We especially recommend a walk through the well-kept garden and take a look at the Bosphorus."

From here came these fabulous mushrooms on legs, or, as they are also called, “fairy chimneys”. The main cluster is near the village of Zelve.",

The history of Derinkuyu is really amazing: it has existed for more than 20 centuries and goes underground for as much as 60 meters (and this, for a moment, is like a 20-story house). In addition to residential premises, wineries, schools, temples, stables and even a cemetery were located inside. Apparently, the Hittites built the city, but the last inhabitants were Christians hiding from the persecution. Tourists can walk along the low corridors and rooms of five floors, the price is 35 TL (€ 6). Not suitable for those who suffer from claustrophobia.",

Even if you are in the city for only a few days, it will definitely come in handy. You can buy a card in a machine at the entrance of the metro (there is a station right at the airport) for 10 lire. And 4 of them will already be on the balance sheet, and then it can be replenished for any amount. Istanbulkart is a pass for all types of public transport, including numerous ferries, and at the same time to public toilets. An irreplaceable, in general, thing. You can ride on one-time tickets, in which case each trip will cost 5 lire.",
                "By the way, about the ferries. Of course, they are sightseeing (if you wish, you can make a circle along the Bosphorus), but in general it is just one of the types of public transport, convenient, inexpensive and very romantic. There are several popular ports: in the European part these are Eminönü, Karaköy, Kabataş and Beşiktaş, in Asia the most significant are Kadşköy and Üsküdar. Ferry timetables can be found here. And don't forget to buy fresh simit bagels to feed the gulls while you ride!",
                "The transportation system in Istanbul is quite complicated: in order not to get lost, download the Trafi Türkiye application. Enter the point of departure and point of arrival - you get tips on how to get, indicating how much you spend time and money. And if you don’t know where you are, the application will tell you the nearest public transport stops using GPS.",
                "Taxi in Istanbul costs 2-3 lira per kilometer. But at rush hour it is better not to use it - there is a risk of getting stuck in traffic for a long time (the İBB Ceptrafik application helps to monitor and predict traffic in Istanbul). In addition, it is worthwhile to make sure that the driver turns on the counter. Calling a taxi by phone does not make much sense: the price will not change, and parking and free cars are often found in the city. But locals consider the BiTaksi application to be quite convenient where, after registering via Facebook, you can track tariffs and GPS tracking, as well as pay for your trip with a credit or debit card."

                "If you decide to thoroughly pump through the history and culture of Istanbul, then be prepared for the fact that you have to compete with tens of thousands of tourists in speed and arrogance. For example, you don’t even have to climb the <b>Galata Tower</b> for the sake of a magnificent view: in the summer on a tiny panoramic balcony there is movement in three rows and annoying traffic jams, and in winter it is just very cold.",
                "But there are places where it is worth to tolerate crowds of tourists, because you certainly will not see such a thing anywhere. For example, the <b>Blue Mosque</b>, it is also <b>Sultanahmet</b> <i>(At Meydanı, 7, Fatih)</i>, the largest in the city, you definitely saw it on any postcard from Turkey. It is called blue because of the white and blue tiles of handmade work, which can be estimated by getting inside. By the way, this can be done for free, the main thing is not to get to the time of prayer (the schedule is indicated next). Upon entering the mosque, go as close to the center as possible and admire the domes, tiles, inscriptions and windows until you feel dizzy.",
                "Behind the Blue Mosque on a pedestrian street lurks a mosaic museum of the <b>Grand Palace</b> <i>(Sultanahmet Mh., Arasta Çarşısı, Fatih)</i>. Once there was an imperial palace, but an earthquake completely destroyed it, and later archaeologists found mosaics, including very ancient ones. An ideal place to immerse yourself in history and relax from the constant chaotic movement of the city.",
                "By the way, lesser-known mosques deserve attention. For example, <b>Suleymaniye</b> <i>(Süleymaniye Mah., Prof. Sıddık Sami Onar cad. 1, Fatih)</i>, which was created for Suleiman the Magnificent by the famous Ottoman architect Sinan. It was recently restored and is now considered the best of the 42 surviving mosques that the architect designed for Istanbul. In addition to the architecture itself, the Suleimaniye feature is that it has preserved most of the original complex of buildings: several madrassas, a hospital, a library and a hamam. And locals are coming here to eat tasty chicken or baked beans.",
                "<b>Hagia Sophia</b> <i>(Sultanahmet Mh., Ayasofya Meydan, Fatih)</i> is another place worth visiting tourists for. This unique building was first an Orthodox cathedral, and then a mosque, and now it is a museum. For more than a thousand years, the cathedral was considered the largest church in the Christian world - until St. Peter's Cathedral was built in Rome. Hagia Sophia is almost 1,500 years old, while the building is in perfect condition. Here you can see the neighborhood of two religions: Christian murals and mosaics are organically combined with quotes from the Koran on huge billboards. Do not forget to climb onto the balcony along the steps that have been groomed for 15 centuries, and also, like every self-respecting tourist, put your finger in the crying column and scroll through 360 degrees, making a wish before it. Ticket price - 60 lire.",
                "<b>Topkapi Palace</b> <i>(Sultanahmet, Fatih)</i> was once the main palace of the Ottoman Empire, it was from here that the sultans ruled the vast state. And now there is a cluster of attractions. It is interesting to see the palaces themselves (and there are four of them - for 7 thousand square meters), to consider courtyards, gates, various premises, chambers and pavilions. Adjacent to the palace is Gülhane Parki, the oldest and one of the largest parks in the city and just a very pleasant place. Thirdly, here in the park you will find the Istanbul Historical Museum of Islamic Science and Technology - come to climb on old optical and astronomical instruments.",
                "<b>The Basilica Cistern</b> <i>(Yerebatan C 13, Sultanahmet)</i> was used as a water storage for residents of the Grand Palace in Byzantine times and the Topkapi Palace during the Ottoman Empire. The place looks completely mystical, given that it is underground - scattered light, powerful columns, methodical rattling of drops and even a couple of Medusa Gorgon, who are not afraid to look in the eyes. One of the few tourist places where even Istanbul people return several times. Entrance - 20 lire.",
                "Be sure to visit the <b>Dolmabahçe Palace</b> - the second residence of the Turkish Sultans. Everything captivates: the palace itself (the so-called office) with the world's largest chandelier, and a harem, and an art gallery (where even Aivazovsky is). We especially recommend a walk through the well-kept garden and take a look at the Bosphorus."

Even if you are in the city for only a few days, it will definitely come in handy. You can buy a card in a machine at the entrance of the metro (there is a station right at the airport) for 10 lire. And 4 of them will already be on the balance sheet, and then it can be replenished for any amount. Istanbulkart is a pass for all types of public transport, including numerous ferries, and at the same time to public toilets. An irreplaceable, in general, thing. You can ride on one-time tickets, in which case each trip will cost 5 lire.",

Of course, they are sightseeing (if you wish, you can make a circle along the Bosphorus), but in general it is just one of the types of public transport, convenient, inexpensive and very romantic. There are several popular ports: in the European part these are Eminönü, Karaköy, Kabataş and Beşiktaş, in Asia the most significant are Kadşköy and Üsküdar. Ferry timetables can be found here. And don't forget to buy fresh simit bagels to feed the gulls while you ride!",

Enter the point of departure and point of arrival - you get tips on how to get, indicating how much you spend time and money. And if you don’t know where you are, the application will tell you the nearest public transport stops using GPS.",
                "Taxi in Istanbul costs 2-3 lira per kilometer. But at rush hour it is better not to use it - there is a risk of getting stuck in traffic for a long time (the İBB Ceptrafik application helps to monitor and predict traffic in Istanbul). In addition, it is worthwhile to make sure that the driver turns on the counter. Calling a taxi by phone does not make much sense: the price will not change, and parking and free cars are often found in the city. But locals consider the BiTaksi application to be quite convenient where, after registering via Facebook, you can track tariffs and GPS tracking, as well as pay for your trip with a credit or debit card."

                "If you decide to thoroughly pump through the history and culture of Istanbul, then be prepared for the fact that you have to compete with tens of thousands of tourists in speed and arrogance. For example, you don’t even have to climb the <b>Galata Tower</b> for the sake of a magnificent view: in the summer on a tiny panoramic balcony there is movement in three rows and annoying traffic jams, and in winter it is just very cold.",
                "But there are places where it is worth to tolerate crowds of tourists, because you certainly will not see such a thing anywhere. For example, the <b>Blue Mosque</b>, it is also <b>Sultanahmet</b> <i>(At Meydanı, 7, Fatih)</i>, the largest in the city, you definitely saw it on any postcard from Turkey. It is called blue because of the white and blue tiles of handmade work, which can be estimated by getting inside. By the way, this can be done for free, the main thing is not to get to the time of prayer (the schedule is indicated next). Upon entering the mosque, go as close to the center as possible and admire the domes, tiles, inscriptions and windows until you feel dizzy.",
                "Behind the Blue Mosque on a pedestrian street lurks a mosaic museum of the <b>Grand Palace</b> <i>(Sultanahmet Mh., Arasta Çarşısı, Fatih)</i>. Once there was an imperial palace, but an earthquake completely destroyed it, and later archaeologists found mosaics, including very ancient ones. An ideal place to immerse yourself in history and relax from the constant chaotic movement of the city.",
                "By the way, lesser-known mosques deserve attention. For example, <b>Suleymaniye</b> <i>(Süleymaniye Mah., Prof. Sıddık Sami Onar cad. 1, Fatih)</i>, which was created for Suleiman the Magnificent by the famous Ottoman architect Sinan. It was recently restored and is now considered the best of the 42 surviving mosques that the architect designed for Istanbul. In addition to the architecture itself, the Suleimaniye feature is that it has preserved most of the original complex of buildings: several madrassas, a hospital, a library and a hamam. And locals are coming here to eat tasty chicken or baked beans.",
                "<b>Hagia Sophia</b> <i>(Sultanahmet Mh., Ayasofya Meydan, Fatih)</i> is another place worth visiting tourists for. This unique building was first an Orthodox cathedral, and then a mosque, and now it is a museum. For more than a thousand years, the cathedral was considered the largest church in the Christian world - until St. Peter's Cathedral was built in Rome. Hagia Sophia is almost 1,500 years old, while the building is in perfect condition. Here you can see the neighborhood of two religions: Christian murals and mosaics are organically combined with quotes from the Koran on huge billboards. Do not forget to climb onto the balcony along the steps that have been groomed for 15 centuries, and also, like every self-respecting tourist, put your finger in the crying column and scroll through 360 degrees, making a wish before it. Ticket price - 60 lire.",
                "<b>Topkapi Palace</b> <i>(Sultanahmet, Fatih)</i> was once the main palace of the Ottoman Empire, it was from here that the sultans ruled the vast state. And now there is a cluster of attractions. It is interesting to see the palaces themselves (and there are four of them - for 7 thousand square meters), to consider courtyards, gates, various premises, chambers and pavilions. Adjacent to the palace is Gülhane Parki, the oldest and one of the largest parks in the city and just a very pleasant place. Thirdly, here in the park you will find the Istanbul Historical Museum of Islamic Science and Technology - come to climb on old optical and astronomical instruments.",
                "<b>The Basilica Cistern</b> <i>(Yerebatan C 13, Sultanahmet)</i> was used as a water storage for residents of the Grand Palace in Byzantine times and the Topkapi Palace during the Ottoman Empire. The place looks completely mystical, given that it is underground - scattered light, powerful columns, methodical rattling of drops and even a couple of Medusa Gorgon, who are not afraid to look in the eyes. One of the few tourist places where even Istanbul people return several times. Entrance - 20 lire.",
                "Be sure to visit the <b>Dolmabahçe Palace</b> - the second residence of the Turkish Sultans. Everything captivates: the palace itself (the so-called office) with the world's largest chandelier, and a harem, and an art gallery (where even Aivazovsky is). We especially recommend a walk through the well-kept garden and take a look at the Bosphorus."

                "If you are traveling to Paris from a European neighboring country, you can try your luck in finding a convenient bus route - the <b>Megabus, Eurolines, Flixbus</b> lines and the national carrier Ouibus are popular. From any part of France to the capital, you can come by train. Monitor the official website of the railway - there are often cool offers there. Do not forget about the Blablacar service, which, incidentally, was invented in France.",
                "The Ile-de-France region, where Paris and its suburbs are located, is divided into five transport zones: the city center fits into the first, the Stade de France Stadium and the Vincennes forest covers zone 2, Orly airport is in the third, Versailles in the fourth, and the airport Charles de Gaulle and Disneyland - in zone 5. When buying a ticket, make sure that it is valid in the right area.",
                "Paris public transport - metro, RER express trains, trams and buses (including night, Noctilien). The fastest and most convenient way is to travel by metro and electric trains: only mopeds are not in traffic jams in Paris, and the entrance to the subway can be found every 2-3 blocks. The underground communications grid consists of 16 metro lines and 5 RER lines (they may be needed by those who wish to ride to Versailles or Disneyland). After midnight, only night buses (with the N sign in front of the number) run through the city; there is no separate type of ticket for them. Noctilien buses run from the center of Paris (Châtelet), and connect the main train stations. For convenient use of public transport, you can download the official application of the Next Stop Paris city network.",
                "The standard ticket “t +” for € 1.90, depending on the type of transport, is valid for 90 minutes (for bus and tram) or 120 minutes (for metro and RER) after activation. It is suitable for trips by metro, high-speed trains in zone 1 (and if you go to Versailles, you need to buy a Billet Origine Destination), tram, bus and funicular in Montmartre. But not all at once: one ticket can combine either the metro and RER, or a bus with a tram.",
                "A single ticket is sold at any station in special machines or at the box office. But it’s more profitable to immediately take a “carnet” - 10 pieces for € 14.90 (for children under 4 years old - free, for children under 11 - for half price). Life hack for young people: those under 26: on weekends you can ride on the Ticket Jeunes Week-end - all day for € 3.85. Finding them in the slot machine is not so simple: these tickets are hiding below under the mysterious “Other Tickets”. By the way, metro and ground transportation cards can be requested for free at any ticket office in the subway.",
                "In addition, unlimited tickets for the day, week and month are sold (they cost differently depending on the zones). The cheapest is Mobilis, a 1-day ticket for an unlimited number of trips within two transport zones, for € 7.50.",
                "You can find a legal taxi by the lights with the inscription “Parisien” on the roof. A kilometer within the ring ('peripheral') and in the suburbs, depending on the time, costs € 1-1.5 in the afternoon, and the nightly rate, of course, may be higher. By the way, in Paris there is also a motorbike, but with luggage it does not fit.",
                "A good alternative to public transportation is the <b>Vélib</b> city bike. Stations where you can take or throw off the bike are also scattered throughout the city. For hire you need to have a bank card and € 150 in your account - they will be written off if the iron horse is not returned to one of the bases. Access to Velib for one day will cost € 1.70, for a week - € 8. Every first half hour of use will be free, for the next 30 minutes - payment of € 1. Accordingly, it is advantageous to ride in short transfers.",
                "<b>Bateau</b> river buses run along the Seine. They make 8 stops in the city center (Notre Dame, Louvre Museum, Orsay Museum, Eiffel Tower, City Hall, Champs Elysees, Saint-Germain-des-Prés and the Botanical Garden). Boats leave every 20-25 minutes from 10:00 to 21:30 (and until 19:00 - in winter). A day ticket costs € 16, and for 48 hours - € 19 (for children under 3 years old - free of charge, up to 16 years old - € 7 and € 10 respectively)."

This is the cradle of Paris. Glimpses of medieval buildings flash in the architecture of the Concierge castle and the Gothic chapel of Saint-Chapelle - parts of the palace ensemble of the 11th-13th centuries. They have a common ticket if purchased at the Concierge. For Zen and Authenticity, head to Ver Galan Square, Dauphin Square and the Cité Flower Market. Notre Dame stands on the island.",
                "<b>Left Bank</b>. On the left bank of the Seine (Rive Gauche) leftist moods arose. The spirit of the twentieth-century philosophy, the theater of the absurd and free-thinking students on the barricades hold the Latin Quarter district of Saint-Germain, which is historically customary to associate with the intelligentsia. Here are the best bookstores (for example, <b>L’Ecume des Pages</b> or <b>Gibert Joseph</b>), a treasure not so much in consumption as in culture. Here, at the theaters <b>Odeon</b> (Place de l'Odéon) and <b>Yuschett</b> (Rue de la Huchette, 23), you can get to the performances of Beckett, Ionesco or Genet. Here stands the oldest Romanesque church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where American gospel choirs often organize concerts due to excellent acoustics.",
                "On the same shore is the <b>Luxembourg Gardens</b> - a great place for an afternoon chill amid large flower beds and the Palace, where the French Senate sits today. This route, through the second-hand bookstalls on the Augustine Quay, was a favorite during the Paris period at Hemingway. Continue on your walk towards the Sorbonne Square and the Sainte-Geneviève University Library - the interior of her reading room is worth the time.",
                "Directly on the course will be the <b>Delacroix House-Museum</b> (rue de Furstenberg, 6), where the artist created, among others, the famous “Freedom on the Barricades”, a symbol of the French Revolution. A regular ticket costs € 7, but you can immediately buy a ticket for € 15, also valid in the Louvre on the day of purchase. Fans of modern art should go to the Cartier Foundation (boulevard Raspail, 261) - a ship made of glass and steel, on board of which there have been excellent art installations for 20 years. Tickets start at € 7.",
                "Nearby is the <b>house-museum of Auguste Rodin</b> (Rue de Varenne, 77), one of the classic locations to visit. In the mansion, where Matisse and Cocteau, among others, hung in the past century, it’s worth not only seeing the sculptor’s work, but also the paintings of Renoir and Van Gogh that he bought, and also a whole room with the creations of his lover, Comilla Claudel.",
                "The <b>Musee d'Orsay</b>, located in the building of the former train station, is most famous for the top floor. That is, the works of the Impressionists Manet and Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Pissarro and Degas and the Post-Impressionists Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, Cezanne, Van Gogh and fifty other masters of the XIX-XX centuries. It’s not worth running right away: the contents of the other floors are no less fantastic. On the first - painting and sculpture until 1870 (including works by Carpo, canvases by Delacroix, Ingres, Courbet; Monet, by the way, is there too), on the second - academic painting, symbolists and naturalists, sculpture by Rodin, Bourdelle, Mayol, and more - the furniture embodiment of modernity and the exposition of interiors.",

A ticket to the world's largest museum costs € 15, but do not waste time - buy it in advance on the Internet! The Louvre is huge. And so that your visit does not repeat the sprint from Godard's Gang of Outsiders, you should prepare for it: look at the plan of museum halls and figure out what you need to see for sure - Michelangelo's sculptures, da Vinci's paintings, treasures of the East or Mesopotamia? Or maybe the apartments of Napoleon III? It's up to you. By the way, after 6 p.m. on Friday young people under 26 years old are allowed inside with any passport for free. The longest of the lines is at the main glass pyramid. You can get around it by diving under the Carruzel Arch.",

Before reaching this quarter, pay homage to the non-profit squatted gallery 59 Rivoli (Rue de Rivoli, 59) in the building of the former bank. Additional options - get to know the authors and leave a voluntary donation: a coin in the recesses at the entrance. Already in Mare, it is easy to find the motley building of the Museum of Modern Art - the Pompidou Center (Place Georges-Pompidou) or otherwise - Bobur.",

You need to go here if you like good music festivals or want to stare at the divas that drop wigs on the dance floor, competing in Vogue dance classes.

It was the local guys who invented the Marseillaise, which later became the French anthem, and prepare the world's best bouillabaisse - a fish soup of ten species of sea reptiles. The city is awake only from 8 to 22, and therefore in planning a weekend in Marseille you need to be a real strategist. Night walks in Marseille have a lot of extreme, so after 10 pm it is much wiser to uncork a bottle of wine, get delicious French cheeses and stay in your room.",

If you fly on a budget (for example, low-cost airlines Ryanair or Wizz Air), the landing will be in the town of Beauvais, 80 kilometers from the capital. <b>Navettes</b> express shuttles depart from there every 15-30 minutes and deliver passengers to Paris in less than an hour and a half. Tickets are sold at the box office or on-site tickets for € 17, online - for € 15.90 (children under 4 years old do not need to pay for a ticket, and up to 12 years a ticket costs € 9.90). The final stop is Porte Maillot: there you can catch the metro and city trains RER.",
                "If you are traveling to Paris from a European neighboring country, you can try your luck in finding a convenient bus route - the <b>Megabus, Eurolines, Flixbus</b> lines and the national carrier Ouibus are popular. From any part of France to the capital, you can come by train. Monitor the official website of the railway - there are often cool offers there. Do not forget about the Blablacar service, which, incidentally, was invented in France.",
                "The Ile-de-France region, where Paris and its suburbs are located, is divided into five transport zones: the city center fits into the first, the Stade de France Stadium and the Vincennes forest covers zone 2, Orly airport is in the third, Versailles in the fourth, and the airport Charles de Gaulle and Disneyland - in zone 5. When buying a ticket, make sure that it is valid in the right area.",
                "Paris public transport - metro, RER express trains, trams and buses (including night, Noctilien). The fastest and most convenient way is to travel by metro and electric trains: only mopeds are not in traffic jams in Paris, and the entrance to the subway can be found every 2-3 blocks. The underground communications grid consists of 16 metro lines and 5 RER lines (they may be needed by those who wish to ride to Versailles or Disneyland). After midnight, only night buses (with the N sign in front of the number) run through the city; there is no separate type of ticket for them. Noctilien buses run from the center of Paris (Châtelet), and connect the main train stations. For convenient use of public transport, you can download the official application of the Next Stop Paris city network.",
                "The standard ticket “t +” for € 1.90, depending on the type of transport, is valid for 90 minutes (for bus and tram) or 120 minutes (for metro and RER) after activation. It is suitable for trips by metro, high-speed trains in zone 1 (and if you go to Versailles, you need to buy a Billet Origine Destination), tram, bus and funicular in Montmartre. But not all at once: one ticket can combine either the metro and RER, or a bus with a tram.",

But it’s more profitable to immediately take a “carnet” - 10 pieces for € 14.90 (for children under 4 years old - free, for children under 11 - for half price). Life hack for young people: those under 26: on weekends you can ride on the Ticket Jeunes Week-end - all day for € 3.85. Finding them in the slot machine is not so simple: these tickets are hiding below under the mysterious “Other Tickets”. By the way, metro and ground transportation cards can be requested for free at any ticket office in the subway.",
                "In addition, unlimited tickets for the day, week and month are sold (they cost differently depending on the zones). The cheapest is Mobilis, a 1-day ticket for an unlimited number of trips within two transport zones, for € 7.50.",
                "You can find a legal taxi by the lights with the inscription “Parisien” on the roof. A kilometer within the ring ('peripheral') and in the suburbs, depending on the time, costs € 1-1.5 in the afternoon, and the nightly rate, of course, may be higher. By the way, in Paris there is also a motorbike, but with luggage it does not fit.",
                "A good alternative to public transportation is the <b>Vélib</b> city bike. Stations where you can take or throw off the bike are also scattered throughout the city. For hire you need to have a bank card and € 150 in your account - they will be written off if the iron horse is not returned to one of the bases. Access to Velib for one day will cost € 1.70, for a week - € 8. Every first half hour of use will be free, for the next 30 minutes - payment of € 1. Accordingly, it is advantageous to ride in short transfers.",

Boats leave every 20-25 minutes from 10:00 to 21:30 (and until 19:00 - in winter). A day ticket costs € 16, and for 48 hours - € 19 (for children under 3 years old - free of charge, up to 16 years old - € 7 and € 10 respectively)."

Glimpses of medieval buildings flash in the architecture of the Concierge castle and the Gothic chapel of Saint-Chapelle - parts of the palace ensemble of the 11th-13th centuries. They have a common ticket if purchased at the Concierge. For Zen and Authenticity, head to Ver Galan Square, Dauphin Square and the Cité Flower Market. Notre Dame stands on the island.",
                "<b>Left Bank</b>. On the left bank of the Seine (Rive Gauche) leftist moods arose. The spirit of the twentieth-century philosophy, the theater of the absurd and free-thinking students on the barricades hold the Latin Quarter district of Saint-Germain, which is historically customary to associate with the intelligentsia. Here are the best bookstores (for example, <b>L’Ecume des Pages</b> or <b>Gibert Joseph</b>), a treasure not so much in consumption as in culture. Here, at the theaters <b>Odeon</b> (Place de l'Odéon) and <b>Yuschett</b> (Rue de la Huchette, 23), you can get to the performances of Beckett, Ionesco or Genet. Here stands the oldest Romanesque church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where American gospel choirs often organize concerts due to excellent acoustics.",

Continue on your walk towards the Sorbonne Square and the Sainte-Geneviève University Library - the interior of her reading room is worth the time.",

A regular ticket costs € 7, but you can immediately buy a ticket for € 15, also valid in the Louvre on the day of purchase.

It’s not worth running right away: the contents of the other floors are no less fantastic. On the first - painting and sculpture until 1870 (including works by Carpo, canvases by Delacroix, Ingres, Courbet; Monet, by the way, is there too), on the second - academic painting, symbolists and naturalists, sculpture by Rodin, Bourdelle, Mayol, and more - the furniture embodiment of modernity and the exposition of interiors.",

                "To teleport from Paris to Giverny for a couple of hours and see <b>Monet's Water Lilies</b>, drop by the <b>Jardin Tuileries Museum</b>. You can also buy a combined ticket Orangerie d’Orsay there. The museum is located on the banks of the Seine, right in the Tuileries Park, one of the first examples of the French regular park from the 16th century.",
                "It’s unlikely that you will lose sight of your plan or the Louvre even if you wish. A ticket to the world's largest museum costs € 15, but do not waste time - buy it in advance on the Internet! The Louvre is huge. And so that your visit does not repeat the sprint from Godard's Gang of Outsiders, you should prepare for it: look at the plan of museum halls and figure out what you need to see for sure - Michelangelo's sculptures, da Vinci's paintings, treasures of the East or Mesopotamia? Or maybe the apartments of Napoleon III? It's up to you. By the way, after 6 p.m. on Friday young people under 26 years old are allowed inside with any passport for free. The longest of the lines is at the main glass pyramid. You can get around it by diving under the Carruzel Arch.",
                "Noisy and motley Paris begins in medieval Marais. Before reaching this quarter, pay homage to the non-profit squatted gallery 59 Rivoli (Rue de Rivoli, 59) in the building of the former bank. Additional options - get to know the authors and leave a voluntary donation: a coin in the recesses at the entrance. Already in Mare, it is easy to find the motley building of the Museum of Modern Art - the Pompidou Center (Place Georges-Pompidou) or otherwise - Bobur.",
                "The continuation of the banquet for digital art nerds is in the center of <b>La Gaité Lyrique</b> <i>(rue Papin, 3B)</i>. You need to go here if you like good music festivals or want to stare at the divas that drop wigs on the dance floor, competing in Vogue dance classes. The program combines everything related to technology, art and pop culture. One should prepare no less than in front of the Louvre: choose a dream event on the website and immediately take tickets - then it will not.",
                "Opera - <b>Palace Garnier</b> should be included in the route of a cultural person. It’s worth going, if not to a performance (and tickets cost from € 5), then to a tour. What for? Admire the interiors and the main staircase, the library and the ceiling, painted by Marc Chagall. Entrance € 11."

The main thing is their special spirit. So, the outskirts of Rivoli still breathe royal imperial luxury, on the paving stones of the left bank of the Seine - traces of May 68th (and under the cobblestones - the beach), and the road to the 'Red Mill', Moulin Rouge, in a cabaret style is lined with a frivolous atmosphere half the world. Paris does not fight clichés. Roasted chestnuts are indeed sold at the Eiffel Tower. Paris is just more than all these cliches. And when you get to the French capital, get to know the whole city, as it should, comme il faut. And we, of course, will help you with this - keep our thoroughly updated guide to the city of dreams - Paris.",

If you fly on a budget (for example, low-cost airlines Ryanair or Wizz Air), the landing will be in the town of Beauvais, 80 kilometers from the capital. <b>Navettes</b> express shuttles depart from there every 15-30 minutes and deliver passengers to Paris in less than an hour and a half. Tickets are sold at the box office or on-site tickets for € 17, online - for € 15.90 (children under 4 years old do not need to pay for a ticket, and up to 12 years a ticket costs € 9.90). The final stop is Porte Maillot: there you can catch the metro and city trains RER.",
                "If you are traveling to Paris from a European neighboring country, you can try your luck in finding a convenient bus route - the <b>Megabus, Eurolines, Flixbus</b> lines and the national carrier Ouibus are popular. From any part of France to the capital, you can come by train. Monitor the official website of the railway - there are often cool offers there. Do not forget about the Blablacar service, which, incidentally, was invented in France.",
                "The Ile-de-France region, where Paris and its suburbs are located, is divided into five transport zones: the city center fits into the first, the Stade de France Stadium and the Vincennes forest covers zone 2, Orly airport is in the third, Versailles in the fourth, and the airport Charles de Gaulle and Disneyland - in zone 5. When buying a ticket, make sure that it is valid in the right area.",

The fastest and most convenient way is to travel by metro and electric trains: only mopeds are not in traffic jams in Paris, and the entrance to the subway can be found every 2-3 blocks. The underground communications grid consists of 16 metro lines and 5 RER lines (they may be needed by those who wish to ride to Versailles or Disneyland). After midnight, only night buses (with the N sign in front of the number) run through the city; there is no separate type of ticket for them. Noctilien buses run from the center of Paris (Châtelet), and connect the main train stations. For convenient use of public transport, you can download the official application of the Next Stop Paris city network.",

It is suitable for trips by metro, high-speed trains in zone 1 (and if you go to Versailles, you need to buy a Billet Origine Destination), tram, bus and funicular in Montmartre. But not all at once: one ticket can combine either the metro and RER, or a bus with a tram.",
                "A single ticket is sold at any station in special machines or at the box office. But it’s more profitable to immediately take a “carnet” - 10 pieces for € 14.90 (for children under 4 years old - free, for children under 11 - for half price). Life hack for young people: those under 26: on weekends you can ride on the Ticket Jeunes Week-end - all day for € 3.85. Finding them in the slot machine is not so simple: these tickets are hiding below under the mysterious “Other Tickets”. By the way, metro and ground transportation cards can be requested for free at any ticket office in the subway.",
                "In addition, unlimited tickets for the day, week and month are sold (they cost differently depending on the zones). The cheapest is Mobilis, a 1-day ticket for an unlimited number of trips within two transport zones, for € 7.50.",
                "You can find a legal taxi by the lights with the inscription “Parisien” on the roof. A kilometer within the ring ('peripheral') and in the suburbs, depending on the time, costs € 1-1.5 in the afternoon, and the nightly rate, of course, may be higher. By the way, in Paris there is also a motorbike, but with luggage it does not fit.",
                "A good alternative to public transportation is the <b>Vélib</b> city bike. Stations where you can take or throw off the bike are also scattered throughout the city. For hire you need to have a bank card and € 150 in your account - they will be written off if the iron horse is not returned to one of the bases. Access to Velib for one day will cost € 1.70, for a week - € 8. Every first half hour of use will be free, for the next 30 minutes - payment of € 1. Accordingly, it is advantageous to ride in short transfers.",

They make 8 stops in the city center (Notre Dame, Louvre Museum, Orsay Museum, Eiffel Tower, City Hall, Champs Elysees, Saint-Germain-des-Prés and the Botanical Garden). Boats leave every 20-25 minutes from 10:00 to 21:30 (and until 19:00 - in winter).

                "<b>Isles of Cite and Saint-Louis</b>. It is better to start acquaintance with Paris from the island of Cité, as the Celts did more than two thousand years ago. This is the cradle of Paris. Glimpses of medieval buildings flash in the architecture of the Concierge castle and the Gothic chapel of Saint-Chapelle - parts of the palace ensemble of the 11th-13th centuries. They have a common ticket if purchased at the Concierge. For Zen and Authenticity, head to Ver Galan Square, Dauphin Square and the Cité Flower Market. Notre Dame stands on the island.",
                "<b>Left Bank</b>. On the left bank of the Seine (Rive Gauche) leftist moods arose. The spirit of the twentieth-century philosophy, the theater of the absurd and free-thinking students on the barricades hold the Latin Quarter district of Saint-Germain, which is historically customary to associate with the intelligentsia. Here are the best bookstores (for example, <b>L’Ecume des Pages</b> or <b>Gibert Joseph</b>), a treasure not so much in consumption as in culture. Here, at the theaters <b>Odeon</b> (Place de l'Odéon) and <b>Yuschett</b> (Rue de la Huchette, 23), you can get to the performances of Beckett, Ionesco or Genet. Here stands the oldest Romanesque church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where American gospel choirs often organize concerts due to excellent acoustics.",
                "On the same shore is the <b>Luxembourg Gardens</b> - a great place for an afternoon chill amid large flower beds and the Palace, where the French Senate sits today. This route, through the second-hand bookstalls on the Augustine Quay, was a favorite during the Paris period at Hemingway. Continue on your walk towards the Sorbonne Square and the Sainte-Geneviève University Library - the interior of her reading room is worth the time.",
                "Directly on the course will be the <b>Delacroix House-Museum</b> (rue de Furstenberg, 6), where the artist created, among others, the famous “Freedom on the Barricades”, a symbol of the French Revolution. A regular ticket costs € 7, but you can immediately buy a ticket for € 15, also valid in the Louvre on the day of purchase. Fans of modern art should go to the Cartier Foundation (boulevard Raspail, 261) - a ship made of glass and steel, on board of which there have been excellent art installations for 20 years. Tickets start at € 7.",
                "Nearby is the <b>house-museum of Auguste Rodin</b> (Rue de Varenne, 77), one of the classic locations to visit. In the mansion, where Matisse and Cocteau, among others, hung in the past century, it’s worth not only seeing the sculptor’s work, but also the paintings of Renoir and Van Gogh that he bought, and also a whole room with the creations of his lover, Comilla Claudel.",
                "The <b>Musee d'Orsay</b>, located in the building of the former train station, is most famous for the top floor. That is, the works of the Impressionists Manet and Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Pissarro and Degas and the Post-Impressionists Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, Cezanne, Van Gogh and fifty other masters of the XIX-XX centuries. It’s not worth running right away: the contents of the other floors are no less fantastic. On the first - painting and sculpture until 1870 (including works by Carpo, canvases by Delacroix, Ingres, Courbet; Monet, by the way, is there too), on the second - academic painting, symbolists and naturalists, sculpture by Rodin, Bourdelle, Mayol, and more - the furniture embodiment of modernity and the exposition of interiors.",
                "For exotics - to the <b>museum on the Branly embankment</b> (quai Branly, 37), where native culture is collected: exhibits from four continents - Africa, Oceania, South America and Asia. Paradise for ethnographers and anthropologists!",

You can also look at the main symbol of the “city of light” from the side, and for the money saved, you can enjoy a picnic on the Champ de Mars or go a bit to the Balzac house-museum (rue Raynouard 47, 16e).",

Do not miss the centers of contemporary art connected by wings: <b>Musée d'Art moderne</b> <i>(11 Avenue du Président Wilson)</i> and <b>Palais de Tokyo</b> <i>(13 Avenue du Président Wilson)</i>. On the lower floor of the latter, there are often yoyo-paris.com parties with good DJs.",

The museum is located on the banks of the Seine, right in the Tuileries Park, one of the first examples of the French regular park from the 16th century.",
                "It’s unlikely that you will lose sight of your plan or the Louvre even if you wish. A ticket to the world's largest museum costs € 15, but do not waste time - buy it in advance on the Internet! The Louvre is huge. And so that your visit does not repeat the sprint from Godard's Gang of Outsiders, you should prepare for it: look at the plan of museum halls and figure out what you need to see for sure - Michelangelo's sculptures, da Vinci's paintings, treasures of the East or Mesopotamia? Or maybe the apartments of Napoleon III? It's up to you. By the way, after 6 p.m. on Friday young people under 26 years old are allowed inside with any passport for free. The longest of the lines is at the main glass pyramid. You can get around it by diving under the Carruzel Arch.",

Before reaching this quarter, pay homage to the non-profit squatted gallery 59 Rivoli (Rue de Rivoli, 59) in the building of the former bank. Additional options - get to know the authors and leave a voluntary donation: a coin in the recesses at the entrance. Already in Mare, it is easy to find the motley building of the Museum of Modern Art - the Pompidou Center (Place Georges-Pompidou) or otherwise - Bobur.",
                "The continuation of the banquet for digital art nerds is in the center of <b>La Gaité Lyrique</b> <i>(rue Papin, 3B)</i>. You need to go here if you like good music festivals or want to stare at the divas that drop wigs on the dance floor, competing in Vogue dance classes. The program combines everything related to technology, art and pop culture. One should prepare no less than in front of the Louvre: choose a dream event on the website and immediately take tickets - then it will not.",
                "Opera - <b>Palace Garnier</b> should be included in the route of a cultural person. It’s worth going, if not to a performance (and tickets cost from € 5), then to a tour. What for? Admire the interiors and the main staircase, the library and the ceiling, painted by Marc Chagall. Entrance € 11."

Millions of years ago, nearby volcanoes covered the territory with ash and lava, and later the wind washed the layers with rain and turned the resulting shapes. From here came these fabulous mushrooms on legs, or, as they are also called, “fairy chimneys”. The main cluster is near the village of Zelve.",

It is conditionally divided into two parts: in one of the tops of the rocks they resemble air meringues or melted ice cream, in the other it is easy to see already abandoned dovecote.",

The history of Derinkuyu is really amazing: it has existed for more than 20 centuries and goes underground for as much as 60 meters (and this, for a moment, is like a 20-story house). In addition to residential premises, wineries, schools, temples, stables and even a cemetery were located inside. Apparently, the Hittites built the city, but the last inhabitants were Christians hiding from the persecution. Tourists can walk along the low corridors and rooms of five floors, the price is 35 TL (€ 6). Not suitable for those who suffer from claustrophobia.",

The most magnificent - the Dark Church (Karanlık Kilise) with restored images of biblical scenes - is paid separately. Cost - 15 TL (€ 2.5).

But their palace is powerful. If the flag is hung on it, then the king is in the country. There is a magnificent park around the palace, where you can hang out. At 13:30 - changing of the guard. Do not miss!",
                "<b>Town Hall</b> <i>(Fridtjof Nansens plass)</i>. The town hall is worth a visit for a cool collection of socialist realism panels and carved wooden paintings with stories of Scandinavian mythology. Free tours are offered three times a day in summer (from 1 July). Outside, you can find the entire skate crowd of the city.",

Therefore, in 1963, a museum of the painter appeared, which exhibits a huge collection of his works: sketches, photographs and notes. And, more precisely, more than a thousand paintings, almost 4,500 drawings and watercolors, more than 15 thousand engravings, 6 sculptures - in a word, there is something to see.",
                "<b>Astrup Fearnley</b> <i>(Strandpromenaden 2)</i>. A large museum of modern art with an impressive collection, housed in a high-tech building that is a work of art in itself. There's even an artificial beach inside, so bring your swim trunks! Entrance € 10.5.",
                "<b>Opera</b> <i>(Kirsten Flagstads pl. 1)</i>. Even if you are not a big fan of classical music, the opera is worth going to just for the building. Try to climb it in the evening - then the view of the city is simply magical!",

You can visit the medieval Norwegian wooden church, of which there are only a few in the country, or dress up in national costumes. It is worth going if you are not planning to ride around the country to get an idea of the culture of different regions. Entrance € 10.5.",
                "<b>Viking Ship Museum</b> <i>(Huk Aveny 35)</i>. Viking ships at their best and other 900-year-old artifacts await you in this unique museum. Unfortunately, there are so many tourists here that it capitally spoils the impression of the cultural trip.",
                "<b>Museum of Kon-Tiki</b> <i>(Bygdøynesveien 36)</i>. Norwegian traveler Thor Heyerdahl riveted a papyrus raft called Kon-Tiki to travel from Peru to Polynesia in 1947.

This is because the city is surrounded by wild forests and the fjord is just a stone's throw from it. You can go to a high-tech opera in the very center, and after 20 minutes you can listen to birds in the forest or barbecue in the park - no one will be surprised.

And, more precisely, more than a thousand paintings, almost 4,500 drawings and watercolors, more than 15 thousand engravings, 6 sculptures - in a word, there is something to see.",

And it's understandable why - this city is loved for its many festivals and a rich cultural life, for its incredible architecture, wildlife in the vicinity and countless pubs and bars. Here everyone will find something to their liking, and the rich history and local flavor will make anyone feel like a hero of a fairy tale. So dress warmly (sometimes a kilt is not an option) and set out on an adventure with local musical influences.",

                "The cheapest way to get to London is from Vilnius with the low-cost <b>Wizzair</b> and <b>Ryanair</b>; <b>AirBaltic</b> very rarely connects to them. Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",
                "By the way, upon arrival, get ready to stand in a small queue for non-EU citizens for about 40 minutes, while the neighboring Euro-queue will have time to miss several flights after you. Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",
                "From Stansted, Luton and Gatwick airports, there is a regular <b>National Express</b> bus that will take you directly to central London at Victoria Station, or further afield if needed. The journey to Victoria Central Station takes about an hour from Luton and Stansted and 1.5-2 hours from Gatwick and will cost about £ 10-14. However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",
                "The main modes of transport in the city itself are subways, buses and Overground trains. Prepare mentally for the high prices for transport, these figures can shock you from habit. Considering the huge scale of London and the variety of areas that you will definitely want to visit, the most profitable option is to buy a pass for a week or a month for zones 1-2: both the main attractions and creative areas are concentrated here. For reference: London is divided into nine zones, where the first is the center and the ninth is the outskirts.",
                "The London Underground has a two-way control system - you use Oyster both at the entrance and at the exit. It's the same story with the tickets - don't forget to pick them up at the entrance. The TFL official website will build the fastest routes for you, and the awesome Citymapper app will calculate the cost and routes for taxi and public transport.",
                "Speaking of taxi. The most inexpensive, reliable and secure service that has already reached England is the Uber app, if you have a credit card to link to your account. Classic black cabs are more expensive, but you can pay with cash."

            "guideCoverInfo": "Perhaps the main noun in English that is synonymous with London is diversity. London is a diversity of cultures and languages, attitudes and mentality, images and lifestyles. London is freedom. Freedom of expression in any way possible. Any point of view has a place to be. Finally, London is love. He will accept you for who you are, and you will definitely love each other.            It would seem that you know by heart all the sights of the capital of England from school topics in English, and therefore we tell you how to have fun in London without visiting Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. Go to the best galleries in the city for free, learn zen in parks and gardens, gobble up farm fast food in the markets, constantly stumble upon places where your favorite films were filmed, make sure you don't get seasick on the second floor of the double decker. And most importantly - have fun!",

                "The cheapest way to get to London is from Vilnius with the low-cost <b>Wizzair</b> and <b>Ryanair</b>; <b>AirBaltic</b> very rarely connects to them. Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",
                "By the way, upon arrival, get ready to stand in a small queue for non-EU citizens for about 40 minutes, while the neighboring Euro-queue will have time to miss several flights after you. Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",
                "From Stansted, Luton and Gatwick airports, there is a regular <b>National Express</b> bus that will take you directly to central London at Victoria Station, or further afield if needed. The journey to Victoria Central Station takes about an hour from Luton and Stansted and 1.5-2 hours from Gatwick and will cost about £ 10-14. However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",
                "The main modes of transport in the city itself are subways, buses and Overground trains. Prepare mentally for the high prices for transport, these figures can shock you from habit. Considering the huge scale of London and the variety of areas that you will definitely want to visit, the most profitable option is to buy a pass for a week or a month for zones 1-2: both the main attractions and creative areas are concentrated here. For reference: London is divided into nine zones, where the first is the center and the ninth is the outskirts.",
                "The London Underground has a two-way control system - you use Oyster both at the entrance and at the exit. It's the same story with the tickets - don't forget to pick them up at the entrance. The TFL official website will build the fastest routes for you, and the awesome Citymapper app will calculate the cost and routes for taxi and public transport.",
                "Speaking of taxi. The most inexpensive, reliable and secure service that has already reached England is the Uber app, if you have a credit card to link to your account. Classic black cabs are more expensive, but you can pay with cash."

There is a place for long quiet walks and loud parties, old quarters and flowering parks, progressive youth and grandmothers with pies by the metro. In Kiev, it's easy to feel like a local, it's easy to meet and fall in love. Maybe that's why now expats from all over the world flock here - to hang out, do business, start families, in short, just live. We have updated the Kiev guide to make you want to come here again and again.",

                "The cheapest way to get to London is from Vilnius with the low-cost <b>Wizzair</b> and <b>Ryanair</b>; <b>AirBaltic</b> very rarely connects to them. Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",
                "By the way, upon arrival, get ready to stand in a small queue for non-EU citizens for about 40 minutes, while the neighboring Euro-queue will have time to miss several flights after you. Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",
                "From Stansted, Luton and Gatwick airports, there is a regular <b>National Express</b> bus that will take you directly to central London at Victoria Station, or further afield if needed. The journey to Victoria Central Station takes about an hour from Luton and Stansted and 1.5-2 hours from Gatwick and will cost about £ 10-14. However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",
                "The main modes of transport in the city itself are subways, buses and Overground trains. Prepare mentally for the high prices for transport, these figures can shock you from habit. Considering the huge scale of London and the variety of areas that you will definitely want to visit, the most profitable option is to buy a pass for a week or a month for zones 1-2: both the main attractions and creative areas are concentrated here. For reference: London is divided into nine zones, where the first is the center and the ninth is the outskirts.",
                "The London Underground has a two-way control system - you use Oyster both at the entrance and at the exit. It's the same story with the tickets - don't forget to pick them up at the entrance. The TFL official website will build the fastest routes for you, and the awesome Citymapper app will calculate the cost and routes for taxi and public transport.",
                "Speaking of taxi. The most inexpensive, reliable and secure service that has already reached England is the Uber app, if you have a credit card to link to your account. Classic black cabs are more expensive, but you can pay with cash."

                "The cheapest way to get to London is from Vilnius with the low-cost <b>Wizzair</b> and <b>Ryanair</b>; <b>AirBaltic</b> very rarely connects to them. Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",
                "By the way, upon arrival, get ready to stand in a small queue for non-EU citizens for about 40 minutes, while the neighboring Euro-queue will have time to miss several flights after you. Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",

The journey to Victoria Central Station takes about an hour from Luton and Stansted and 1.5-2 hours from Gatwick and will cost about £ 10-14. However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",

Considering the huge scale of London and the variety of areas that you will definitely want to visit, the most profitable option is to buy a pass for a week or a month for zones 1-2: both the main attractions and creative areas are concentrated here. For reference: London is divided into nine zones, where the first is the center and the ninth is the outskirts.",

The TFL official website will build the fastest routes for you, and the awesome Citymapper app will calculate the cost and routes for taxi and public transport.",

Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",
                "By the way, upon arrival, get ready to stand in a small queue for non-EU citizens for about 40 minutes, while the neighboring Euro-queue will have time to miss several flights after you. Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",

The journey to Victoria Central Station takes about an hour from Luton and Stansted and 1.5-2 hours from Gatwick and will cost about £ 10-14. However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",

For reference: London is divided into nine zones, where the first is the center and the ninth is the outskirts.",

Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",

Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",

However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",

Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",
                "By the way, upon arrival, get ready to stand in a small queue for non-EU citizens for about 40 minutes, while the neighboring Euro-queue will have time to miss several flights after you. Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",

The journey to Victoria Central Station takes about an hour from Luton and Stansted and 1.5-2 hours from Gatwick and will cost about £ 10-14. However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",

Considering the huge scale of London and the variety of areas that you will definitely want to visit, the most profitable option is to buy a pass for a week or a month for zones 1-2: both the main attractions and creative areas are concentrated here. For reference: London is divided into nine zones, where the first is the center and the ninth is the outskirts.",

Prices start at £ 20 one way (by the way, for £ 1 they give now € 1.4), and the average price for a round-trip ticket is £ 50 light and at least £ 30 for luggage in both directions. If you plan to shop properly, WizzAir allows you to buy thick suitcases of 32 kg. But if you decide to buy a large one, make sure that the suitcase is not heavier - law-abiding Englishmen will not miss extra pounds, even for an additional fee. Another advantage of WizzAir is that the time of departure and arrival from / to Vilnius is easy to dock with the Minsk train, but RyanAir has only late flights.",
                "By the way, upon arrival, get ready to stand in a small queue for non-EU citizens for about 40 minutes, while the neighboring Euro-queue will have time to miss several flights after you. Before checking the documents, do not forget to find and fill out a special temporary resident card for England and indicate your details, as in your passport, and the address of stay - make sure that you have it written somewhere. Officers can ask a couple of simple questions, such as why you came to England and what you are going to see. Take your prints. Smile!",

The journey to Victoria Central Station takes about an hour from Luton and Stansted and 1.5-2 hours from Gatwick and will cost about £ 10-14. However, if you know the date of your departure, it would be more logical to immediately buy round-trip tickets, the return price is the same - £ 13-15. You can easily buy tickets directly at the airport in the National Express window (Single or return to Victoria). For the most zealous, there is also <b>Easybus</b> - with a fortunate coincidence, you can buy a ticket to the city for £ 1.95. Rolls in your pocket? Now follow the directional arrows to the buses. Give a ticket to the driver at the entrance and go ahead and discover London.",

For reference: London is divided into nine zones, where the first is the center and the ninth is the outskirts.",

With its luxury, the dome will surely impress you. In fine weather, you can climb the roofs of both shops and sit on an artificial lawn, enjoy the panorama of the city and eat a sandwich brought with you."
